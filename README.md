# About
Hi there! My name is **Chingam Fong** *(both Chi-um and Chin-gum are acceptable pronounciation, or you can call me by my Chinese name 房智岩)*. Since 2021, I have been a Physics Ph.D. student in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, studying under Professor Kenny C. Y. Ng. 

Currently my project is on cosmic ray interaction in the inner heliosphere and interaction with the Sun.
